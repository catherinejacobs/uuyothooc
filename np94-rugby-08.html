Hi all , seeing as we are deep into the depression of the off-season, and i'm having a quiet Easter Sunday here in Ireland, I decided to try and create an easy-access guide to rugby union. I've been playing rugby all my life, and have been following the NFL avidly since 2008 (HTTR!), so I feel well placed to create a guide such as this, being able to consider intricacies of both sports. Enjoy! I welcome all criticism by the way, give me a shout if something isn't quite right. For Rugby 08 on the PC, GameFAQs has 1 critic review. So the rest of you don't have to. Really was expecting it to be bad, went in with the lowest of expectations. It is worse than anything I could have imagined in a modern game. Some things after a couple of games. Graphics: So unbelievably bad. Not as good as rugby 08, and I'm not saying that for dramatic effect. Only one generic stadium. Thats right, ONE! And even it looks terrible with its non scaling skybox in the background. Never gets in close on any player, with good reason I'd imagine.

I've wanted EA to make another rugby game for years now and I'm sure a lot of you probably feel the same way. Rugby '08 for PS2 is still better than all of the other rugby games I've played over the past few years (World Cup 2011, Jonah lomu's rugby challenge). With all of the improvements in their other titles like FIFA and Madden, I'm sure they could make a great rugby title with plenty of depth and extra features as well.
